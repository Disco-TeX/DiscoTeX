#### What is it?
DiscoTeX is suite of tools to display beautiful mathematical documents on the web.
#### Doesn't MathJax already do that?
MathJax is great for displaying mathematical formulas, but it's primary purpose is not to typeset entire documents. The aim of DiscoTeX is to use the interactivity of the web to improve the experience of reading mathematics. This means we want simple ways to implement document structure that already exists within the TeX/LaTeX framework, such as theorems, proofs, tables, references, and dozens of other things we haven't even thought of yet.
#### How do I use it?
There are two ways:
1. You can write HTML with our custom tags.
2. You can take your TeX file, and run it through the DiscoTeX compiler, to generate valid, beautiful HTML.
#### Can I see it in action?
This demo webpage was generated from a this TeX file.
#### Is it fast?
Super fast.
