DiscoTeX
======

DiscoTeX is an attempt to turn .tex files into web pages,
and in the process add nice features that PDFs lack.
Examples include better references and citations,
and interactive environments such as collapsible proofs.

At the moment, this project is not ready for real use
and its presence here is for the purpose of proof-of-concept.
However, you can view a demo of the existing functionality
[here](http://ted-dokos.github.io/DiscoTeX/).
